This project was done in collaboration with 3 other classmates of mine. It mostly focuses on System Development, as we are still beginners in Java. The main idea of this project was to improve our teamwork and communication skills and to experience a real life scenario of the process of developing a program.

Our task was to create a new or update the existing system of our university's library. The librarian was our customer and we had a Q&A with her regarding the requirements for the system. Then we proceeded with creating UML Diagrams for the use cases in the overall workflow of the system. The project was finished with a written report.
